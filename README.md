# NeuralHire
Created a site, that predicts amount of money you can get and helps to find you a job.
> Site uses data from https://russia.superjob.ru

# About

It is Django website connected to PostgresSQL. Base of the site is a model. Model can predict fee based on other jobs in database. 
Model already done and just imports in view.py, so you can get your prediction faster. 

> I use RandomForest classifier, because neural network is too complex to do and I also need to learn in school.
